h1. Hello

Hello is a yaml file of the word "hello" in many languages and dialects.

There is also a Ruby interface to it so you can show Flickr-style flash messages after your users sign in to your web application:

    Hello.random

By default, the word you get is time-neutral and religious-neutral. It is intended to be directed at one person of any gender or any age. The "hello" may be formal or informal.

Expand the list of "hello"s by gender:

    Hello.random(:gender => :male)
    Hello.random(:gender => :female)

Expand the list of "hello"s by time of day:

    Hello.random(:time => :morning)
    Hello.random(:time => :afternoon)
    Hello.random(:time => :evening)

Adjustments to the list are... welcome.
